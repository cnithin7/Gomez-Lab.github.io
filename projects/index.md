  <h2>Genomics of Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</h2>

  <p><strong>Background</strong><br>
  Although Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is relatively uncommon (~7000â€“7500 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States), it comprises ~10% of lymphomas in the western world. The treatment of HL is relatively successful. However, patients who relapse or are refractory to treatment have few secondary treatment options, and overall survival remains low in this patient population.</p>

  <p><strong>Objective</strong><br>
  A better understanding of the pathobiology of this disease is an important clinical goal. This project aims to address these challenges by using cutting-edge genomic technologies to study Hodgkin lymphoma, which is defined by a rare malignant cell population. Traditional methods struggle with such cancers, leaving many aspects of its biology poorly understood.</p>

  <h2>Health Disparities in Multiple Myeloma</h2>

  <p><strong>Background</strong><br>
  Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells in bone marrow that accounts for 14% of all hematologic cancers and is essentially incurable. It is accepted that all MM is preceded by the benign expansion of clonal plasma cells called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering MM (SMM). When self-identified race is used, African Americans (AAs) have a twofold increase in risk for MM compared to European Americans (EAs) and are diagnosed at younger ages. Consistent with the increase in risk, AAs have a fourfold higher prevalence of MGUS, and MGUS often occurs at younger ages in AA patients.</p>

  <p><strong>Objective</strong><br>
  Our research aims to elucidate the genomic, transcriptomic, and tumor microenvironment (TME) differences between multiple myeloma (MM) patients of European (EA) and African American (AA) descent that may explain some of the health disparities associated with this disease. Currently we are collaborating with Dr. Linda Baugh (Mayo Clinic Rochester) to study the tumor microenvironment in AA and EA MM patients.</p>
