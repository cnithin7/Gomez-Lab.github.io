<h2 id="hodgkin-lymphoma-research-project">Hodgkin Lymphoma Research Project</h2>

<p><strong>Overview</strong><br>
Although Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is relatively uncommon (~7000â€“7500 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States), it comprises ~10% of lymphomas in the western world. The treatment of HL is relatively successful. However, patients who relapse or are refractory to treatment have few secondary treatment options, and overall survival remains low in this patient population.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong><br>
A better understanding of the pathobiology of this disease is an important clinical goal. This project aims to address these challenges by using cutting-edge genomic technologies to study Hodgkin lymphoma, which is often defined by rare malignant cell populations. Traditional methods struggle with such cancers, leaving many aspects poorly understood.</p>

<p><strong>Approach</strong><br>
We will use new technologies and various sources of DNA and RNA to explore somatic variation and gene expression patterns in Hodgkin lymphoma. This study will focus on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Investigating the biology of HL to better understand its etiology.</li>
  <li>Producing data that may inform new treatment strategies by examining the cells responsible for the disease.</li>
  <li>Exploring the immune environment that supports the proliferation of malignant cells.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Impact</strong><br>
The knowledge generated from this project will provide a foundational understanding of the biological processes underlying Hodgkin lymphoma. This could pave the way for innovative treatment options for patients with limited secondary therapy options.</p>
